# Installation #
## Zen HTML ##
  * Unzip `Zen HTML UltraEdit.js` to a sensible location.
  * In UltraEdit open the "Scripting" menu and select "Scripts..."
  * In the Script dialog, select "add" and locate the file `Zen HTML UltraEdit.js`
  * Assign a Hotkey (eg. CTRL+,) to the script
  * Have fun!

**NOTE:** currently only the CSS to HTML part is working. UltraEdit does already have a CSS autocomplete and some other cool stuff, but feel free to contribute ^^)
